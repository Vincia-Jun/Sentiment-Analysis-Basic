# Sentiment-Analysis-Basic
This is a basic code repository for text sentiment analysis. It is used to store and open source the mid-term report code, and is also for beginners to easily review. The repository contains the model framework, training code framework and testing code framework of classic models such as TextCNN, TextRNN, TextRCNN, TextRNN-Att, Transformer, etc.

## 🚩Quick Start
You can modify the model, training, testing and other configurations in the [`main.py`](https://github.com/Vincia-Jun/Sentiment-Analysis-Basic/blob/main/main.py). Then you can simply run:
```
python main.py
```
